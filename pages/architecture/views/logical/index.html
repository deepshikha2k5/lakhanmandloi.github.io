<h3 id="logical-view">Logical View</h3>

<p>The logical view of Sunbird comprises of the following entities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sunbird Functional Entities</li>
  <li>Access to Sunbird</li>
  <li>Underlying Sunbird Platform</li>
  <li>Sunbird Infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sunbird Functional Entities</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird has a varied and diverse user base. Users play different set of roles, their dependence on content-creation and content-consumption decides their respective roles. 
In this context, a user can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Admin</li>
  <li>Instructor</li>
  <li>Student</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are soul of Sunbird. They create, manage and consume content in a well-organized order. The content creation is done using the Sunbird platform provides UI which is rich and user friendly. It provides state of art tools and features to work with. The content delivery is done using an intuitive and interactive set of UI tools. The communication between the layers renders the invoked services i.e., from providing UI to processing the user requests. The Underlying technology gives rich user experience and ensures ease of access with anything users are working with.</p>

<p><strong>Sunbird Access</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird can be accessed both using web and on mobile platform.</p>

<p><strong>Sunbird Platform</strong></p>

<p>The Sunbird platform essentially embeds Service Oriented Architecture, which is a loosely-coupled architecture designed to meet the business needs of the organization.</p>

<p>These form the core of the Sunbird.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional Entities</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Service Entities</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The platform offers and facilitates these functional entities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Organisation</li>
  <li>Course</li>
  <li>Resources</li>
  <li>Community</li>
</ol>

<p>For functional entities description, refer to conceptual view. The service entities with functional entities for the core or platform of Sunbird.</p>

<p><strong>API Gateways:</strong> Sunbird uses modern Micro service Architecture form which provides an intuitive way to hide the services behind a new service layer and provide APIs which are tailored to each client. This aggregator service layer is also known as API Gateway. API gateway permits orchestration, which enables micro services to arrange how the requests are being processed by the architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Restful API’s:</strong> Sunbird deploys RESTful API’s. The Stateless nature of RESTful Sunbird API’s can freely be re-deployed if something fails. Principally, Sunbird establishes a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods. Sunbird ideally capitalizes on to keep the interface generalized and allows users to be explicit about the operations they invoke. Also, Sunbird uses Wrapper API’s to expose an API in a much flexible and friendlier way. These wrapper API’s ease in handling requests and provide a simple set of methods that can be called in wrapper code.</p>

<p><strong>Single Sign on Service(SSO):</strong> With single sign-on service, Sunbird users only have to enter one set of credentials to access their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets. This greatly increases productivity while keeping data secure.</p>

<p><strong>Elastic search:</strong> Sunbird platform provides distributed “Elastic search”. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, data is centrally stored to discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>Rich Analytics, Insights &amp; Telemetry:</strong> Sunbird has rich Analytic mechanism with telemetric approach. It has powerful tools to analyze how users engage with the content. Real-time reports uncover insights into user online behavior that helps to deliver better content which users want to interact with.</p>

<p><strong>Sunbird Infrastructure</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird works around a dynamic resource center, and data-aware environment. Its infrastructure is designed such that it reduces multiple silos, uneven processing and delayed results that come with diverse users and complex application portfolios. Sunbird infrastructure holds all the required contextual information.</p>

<p>Sunbird Infrastructure primarily provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taxonomy</li>
  <li>Content repository</li>
  <li>Learning management system</li>
  <li>User management system</li>
  <li>Content Editor</li>
  <li>Services for data analytics, data exhaust and telemetry</li>
</ul>
