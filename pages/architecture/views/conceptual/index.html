<h4 id="course">Course</h4>

<p>A course is an illustration of content that comprises of the contextual information like the duration of course, type of delivery, organization offering the course, faculty, etc. The course becomes available for Sunbird users based on above contextual information.</p>

<p><strong>Course Management</strong></p>

<p>An organization or a user, with course creation privileges, creates and launches a course in Sunbird. 
The course content, structure, information and meta data of the course are stored in Sunbird platform. The platform empowers vast flexibility in course creation, delivery and consumption. Information like the start &amp; end dates of the course, type of the course, user &amp; organization who created the course, etc.is stored in the course entity at Sunbird layer. A course is visible to users only when the course is in “Live” state. The course creator change the status. There is no versioning of courses in Sunbird. Versioning is prime function of Sunbird platform itself.
The Course entity in Sunbird is designed around the following objects and attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> Course Id,Content Id,Version,Created By,Organization Id,Faculty Id, Tutors,Course Type, etc.</p>

<p><strong>User Courses</strong></p>

<p>Users in Sunbird can explore and subscribe for the Live courses. Once subscribed, the user’s progress and activity within the course is stored in “user courses” entities. User courses contains the subscription data, progress, grade &amp; current position of the user in a course.“User Content State” and “User Assessment Items” data gets populated by listening to the telemetry events generated by the client applications. Asynchronous back-end jobs listening for updates on “User Assessment Items” and “User Content State” updates the progress, grade and last position in the course for each user’s course subscription.</p>

<p>User courses entity in Sunbird is designed around the following objects and attributes:</p>

<p><strong>User Courses:</strong> User Id,Course Id,Delta-TOC,Progress,Grade,Last Content Id.</p>

<p><strong>User content state</strong></p>

<p>It contains the consumption details of content (inside or outside a course) by a user.User Content State entity in Sunbird is designed around the following objects and attributes: 
<strong>User Content State</strong>:User Id,Content Id,Course Id, Consumption Status,Score,Result,Grade,View Count,Completion Count,etc.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<p>In addition to the learning content, a course also encompasses assessments. Sunbird content containing ItemSets are used to deliver assessments in a course. An ItemSet is a collection of assessment items and configuration to be used by player to play it.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evaluation Rubric:</strong> Rubric is the scoring guide to evaluate the assessment and generate a grade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The content player uses ItemSet and its configuration to show the assessment and the course player uses the release criteria &amp; rubric to release and evaluate the assessment.
The Assessment entity in Sunbird is designed around the following objects:</p>

<p><strong>AssessmentId:</strong> Identifier of the Sunbird content which contains the assessment,other attributes <strong>ReleaseCriteria</strong>, <strong>Rubric</strong>.</p>

<p>Sunbird ItemSets and content is flexible and reusable in multiple contexts. This data is stored within the Sunbird infrastructure
User Assessment Items contains the details of each attempt of all assessment items by the user are stored in “User Assessment Items” model.User Assessment Items entity in Sunbird is designed around the following objects:</p>

<p><strong>User assessment:</strong> User Id,Course Id,Assessment Id,Assessment Item Id,Score,
,Result,Attempt Number,Last Attempted On.</p>
