<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird can run on Virtual Machines (VMs) on various Cloud providers or bare metal. Cloud Infrastructure automation is work in progress.</p>

<p><strong>Stable Builds Registry</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird builds are available at a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/sunbird/dashboard/">Image Registry</a>. These builds are in the form of a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a>. Stable releases are tagged as <code>gold</code>. Deployment scripts pull the <code>gold</code> images for production deployment. The <code>gold</code> images are also versioned to allow for release management and upgrade paths.</p>

<p><strong>Software Runtime</strong></p>

<p>Most runtimes in Sunbird are containerized as <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-container">Docker containers</a> for portability, process isolation and standardization.<br />
For container orchestration, this repo contains scripts to run Sunbird on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>. Cloud providers provide container services. In this repo, we are using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine">ACS-Engine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Logging, Monitoring and Operational dashboards</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird comes with log aggregation and metrics reporting out of the box. For log aggregation, Sunbird is using a combination of <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor">cAdvisor</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack">ELK stack</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and their plugin ecosystem.
Ops dashboards are built using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> with some <a href="https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/master/cloud/monitoring/grafana">reference</a> dashboards.</p>

<p><strong>Custom builds</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird is extendible. Sunbird can be taken as a base image with custom implementation of public interfaces and rebuilt for deployment. Scripts are available for ramping up of complex deployments with support to run local build promotions and deployments.</p>
