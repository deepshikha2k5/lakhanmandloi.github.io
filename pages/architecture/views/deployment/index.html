<p><strong>Software Runtime</strong></p>

<p>Most runtimes in Sunbird are containerized as <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-container" target="_blank">Docker containers</a> for: 
- Portability
- Process isolation
- Standardization.<br />
For container orchestration, this repo contains scripts to run Sunbird on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a>. Most of the cloud providers provide these container services. In our repo, we are using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine" target="_blank">ACS-Engine</a>.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack" target="_blank">ELK stack</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> and their plugin ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ops dashboards are built using: <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a> with some <a href="https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/master/cloud/monitoring/grafana" target="_blank">reference</a> dashboards.</p>

<p><strong>Custom builds</strong></p>

<p>Sunbird enables its users to feature of extendibility.A user can take as a base image with custom implementation of public interfaces and rebuild it for deployment. Scripts are available for ramping up of complex deployments with support to run local build promotions and deployments.</p>
