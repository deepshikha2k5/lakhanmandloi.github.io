<p><strong>After content is uploaded on the platform, do updates made to the original content in the organization’s repository reflect automatically in platform’s repository?</strong></p>

<p>The platform has only one common repository for all organizations.</p>

<p>If the organization maintains a separate repository, the content in that repository does not automatically reflect in the platform’s repository. Any updates made to content in the organization’s repository must be re-uploaded on the platform’s site. The uploaded content undergoes the review process, before it is re-published on the platform.</p>

<p>Content that is already submitted to the platform repository can be modified using platform’s in-built content editor. To make changes or modify uploaded content:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click Edit on the content to be modified</li>
  <li>Modify the content</li>
  <li>Save the changes</li>
  <li>Send the artefact for review</li>
  <li>The artefact will be published after review</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Does any change in the organization’s content repository affect the content repository on the platform?</strong></p>

<p>The content in the organization’s repository does not automatically reflect in the platform’s repository. Changes to the organization’s repository do not affect the platform’s content repository.</p>

<p><strong>Is the content provided stored in platform’s repository?</strong></p>

<p>All content uploaded and published on the platform is stored in platform’s content repository.</p>
