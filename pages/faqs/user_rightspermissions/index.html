<p><strong>What user roles does the platform support?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, Sunbird users are categorized as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organization Administrator</li>
  <li>System Administrator</li>
  <li>Content Creator</li>
  <li>Content Reviewer</li>
  <li>Flag Reviewer</li>
  <li>Course Mentor</li>
  <li>Registered User</li>
</ul>

<p>The workflows for all user roles can be configured.</p>

<p><strong>How do you get content creation rights on the platform?</strong></p>

<p>The platform has set protocols for user roles and functionalities. The user base follows a certain hierarchy, where the administrators provide rights and permissions to other users, based on need, to accomplish their tasks across the platform.</p>

<p>Strategically, every state should have designated system administrators, who create and assign rights to organizational administrators, who in turn create and assign content creator, reviewer or general user permissions.</p>

<p>Content creators use the in-built content authoring tool to create new lessons, courses, etc. on the portal.</p>

<p>The process to get content creation rights is depicted in the following conceptual diagram:</p>

      </a></p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between the User ID of an administrator and a general user?</strong></p>

<p>User IDs of administrators are not different from any other user. However, the permissions provided to administrators differ from other users.</p>

<p><strong>What data does a content provider see?</strong></p>

<p>While creating content, content providers can see following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content creation trend over time (by status - draft, review, published)</li>
  <li>Single statistics for number of authors</li>
  <li>Number of reviewers</li>
  <li>Total content pieces created (by status - draft, review, published)</li>
</ul>

<p>While viewing content, content providers can see following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumption trend over time</li>
  <li>Single statistics for number of organization members,</li>
  <li>Total user visits</li>
  <li>Total time for content views,</li>
  <li>Total number of content pieces viewed,</li>
  <li>Average time spent per user per visit</li>
</ul>
