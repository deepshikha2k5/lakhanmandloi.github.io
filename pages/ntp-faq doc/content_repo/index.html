<h1 id="content-repositories">Content Repositories</h1>

<p><strong>After content is uploaded on the platform, do updates made to the original content in the organization’s repository reflect automatically in platform’s repository?</strong>
The platform has only one common repository for all organizations.</p>

<p>If the organization maintains a separate repository, the content in that repository does not automatically reflect in the platform’s repository. Any updates made to content in the organizationâ€™s repository must be re-uploaded on the platform’s site. The uploaded content undergoes the review process, before it is re-published on the platform.</p>

<p>Content that is already submitted to the platform repository can be modified using platformâ€™s in-built content editor. To make changes or modify uploaded content:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click Edit on the content to be modified</li>
  <li>Modify the content</li>
  <li>Save the changes</li>
  <li>Send the artefact for review</li>
  <li>The artefact will be published after review</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Does any change in the organization’s content repository affect the content repository on the platform?</strong>
### Incorporating Review Changes
If there are corrections or modifications to be made, the creator needs to rework on the content. After incorporating the review comments, the creator must submit the content for a review again.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>
<em>The reviewed content that needs rework is displayed in your workspace under Drafts. Click on the content to edit and make the changes</em></p>

<p><strong>Is the content provided stored in platform’s repository?</strong>
All content uploaded and published on the platform is stored in platform’s content repository.</p>
