<h2 id="how-resource-bundle-work">How Resource Bundle Work</h2>

<p>The Resource Bundle reads a property file based on the locale and name suffix used in the naming of the property. For example, consider a label file named en.properties. This file is read by ResourceBundle helper(app/helpers/resourceBundlesHelper.js) and it will generate js file in app/common folder .
Locale represents a region or location with its attributes. Locale is generally used to maintain details about the client using our application. Locale contains attributes of location and language to be used for the respective location. Thus, a Locale assists ResourceBundle to pick the right label file by determining the location to which the user belongs.</p>
