<p>This page provides a summarized listing of the essential steps for planning, installing, and configuring Sunbird deployment in a live environment. The deployment of Sunbird requires several distributed components for runtime operation. The installation process is simplified for some common scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="size-and-verify-your-environment">Size and Verify Your Environment**</h2>

<p>See the prerequisites for installation. Additional requirements for installation might apply based on the environment on which you install Sunbird and how you use Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-an-installation-method">Choosing an Installation method</h3>

<p>Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different options for installing and running Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>Each of the installation option requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. 
At a minimum, you should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS).</li>
  <li>Comfortable with a terminal. Sunbird installation is triggered from the command-line terminal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-try-sunbird">I want to try Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the <a href="https://staging.open-sunbird.org/" target="_blank">Sunbird sandbox</a> which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-extend-sunbird">I want to extend Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the process <a href="developer-docs/installation/installing_sunbirdon_laptop/" target="_blank">Developer installation</a>. This will get you started quickly so you can start extending Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-deploy-an-instance-of-sunbird-for-0-10k-users">I want to deploy an instance of Sunbird for 0-10k users</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the process <a href="developer-docs/installation/medium_scale_deploy/" target="_blank">Medium scale deployment</a>. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-deploy-an-instance-of-sunbird-for-10k-users">I want to deploy an instance of Sunbird for 10k+ users</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10k+ users, we recommend you follow the <a href="" target="_blank">Large scale deployment</a> process. 
This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.</p>
