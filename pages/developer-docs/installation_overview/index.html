<p>If you’ve read the Sunbird architecture description, you will be aware that it requires several distributed components for runtime operation. This is web-based system,which means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must  run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. Getting started with this complexity can be cumbersome. Fortunately,we’ve simplified the installation process for some common scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing an installation method</strong></p>

<p>Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different options for installing and running Sunbird.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p>

<p>Each of the installation option requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. 
At a minimum, you should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS).</li>
  <li>Comfortable with a terminal. Sunbird installation is triggered from the command-line terminal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Installation Options</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to try Sunbird</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the <a href="https://staging.open-sunbird.org/">Sunbird sandbox</a> which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to extend Sunbird</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the process <a href="developer-docs/developer_install">Developer installation</a>. This will get you started quickly so you can start extending Sunbird.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to deploy 0-10k users on Sunird</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the process <a href="developer-docs/medium_scale_deploy">Medium scale deployment</a>. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.
- I want to deploy 10k+ users on Sunbird</p>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10k+ users, we recommend you follow the <a href="developer-docs/large_scale_deploy">Large scale deployment</a> process. 
This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.</p>
