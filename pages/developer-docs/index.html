<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>If you’ve read the Sunbird architecture description, you will be aware that it requires several distributed components for runtime operation. This is web-based system,which means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must  run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. Getting started with this complexity can be cumbersome. Fortunately,we’ve simplified the installation process for some common scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-installation-method">Choosing an installation method</h2>
<p>Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different options for installing and running Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Each of the installation option requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. 
At a minimum, you should be:
* Using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS).
* Comfortable with a terminal.Sunbird installation is triggered from the command-line terminal.
Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-try-sunbird">I want to try Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the <a href="https://staging.open-sunbird.org/">Sunbird sandbox</a> which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-extend-sunbird">I want to extend Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the process <a href="/developer-docs/developer_install">Developer installation</a>. This will get you started quickly so you can start extending Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-a-medium-scale-deployment-of-sunird">I want a medium scale deployment of Sunird</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the process <a href="/developer-docs/medium_scale_deploy">Medium scale deployment</a>. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-a-large-scale-deployment-of-sunbird">I want a large scale deployment of Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10k+ users, we recommend you follow the <a href="/developer-docs/large_scale_deploy">Large scale deployment</a> process. 
This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.</p>
