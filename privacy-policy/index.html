						<h1>Sunbird Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p>Sunbird is an open source project of EkStep Foundation. This Privacy Policy sets forth the standards that Sunbird ( “Sunbird”) will follow with regard to all activities undertaken and information provided by visitors to www.sunbird.org (the “ Sunbird website”) who subscribe to any of Sunbird’s electronic information services, or otherwise affirmatively communicate with Sunbird (all such visitors are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Users”).</p>
						<p><strong>Section 1. Information collected</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird collects information about Users of Sunbird’s website in order to provide electronic information services, and construct a secure and personalised Internet resource.</p>
						<p>The following list includes the different types of information Sunbird collects:</p>
						<p><strong>(A) Personal Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact Users, including, for example, Users’ names, organisations and email addresses. Personal Information does not include aggregated information or information about Users that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. For example, statistics about how many persons visited the Sunbird’s website last month is not Personal Information.</p>
						<p><strong>(B) Nonpersonally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Nonpersonally Identifiable Information” is anonymous information about Users that does not include Users’ names or contact information. Examples of such aggregated data would be IP addresses, browser types, and access times. Sunbird may use this information to customise Sunbird’s website for Users and may not include or refer to Personal Information, such as Users’ email addresses, when using this type of data.</p>
						<p><strong>(C) Aggregated Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Aggregated Information” refers to information that Sunbird gathers by aggregating Nonpersonally Identifiable Information to provide summaries of use of the Sunbird’s website. Sunbird uses Aggregated Information to show usage patterns and to do such things as negotiate with vendors of Internet services. Such Information is not linked to Users’ Personal Information.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 2. Personal information Sunbird collects</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird may collect Personal Information when Users:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Sign up as subscribers to electronic information services;</li>
						<li>Make changes to their subscriber profile information; or</li>
						<li>Send messages, forms, or other information to Sunbird via email or the Sunbird’s website.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When Users sign up as subscribers to electronic information services, Sunbird asks for Personal Information, such as email addresses, to allow Sunbird to create Users’ accounts, respond to Users’ questions, or contact Users regarding their accounts.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 3. Sunbird’s use of personal information</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird uses Users’ Personal Information to provide electronic information services, to create a secure and personalised service for its Users, and to contact them, if Users expressly consent, regarding updates about the website and services.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 4. Disclosure of personal information</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird shall not disclose Users’ Personal Information to third parties without Users’ permission. So, for example, Sunbird does not sell Users’ email addresses or other Personal Information to mass marketers. Sunbird  may disclose Nonpersonally Identifiable Information and Aggregated Information about its Users, but that information does not contain Personal Information. If law enforcement or judicial authorities require Sunbird to provide Personal Information concerning any Users, Sunbird must cooperate with the authorities if their requirement is supported with the necessary legal documentation.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 5. Consent</strong></p>
						<p>When Users use Sunbird’s website, they are using a service provided by the Sunbird and therefore agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy addresses only activities connected with the Sunbird’s servers. Other sites, including those that Sunbird links to and third-party sites or services that the Sunbird co-brands, may have their own policies, which Sunbird does not control and are not addressed or controlled by this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 6. Choices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of personal information</strong></p>
						<p>Users may limit the collection and use of different elements of their Personal Information by not participating in those activities in which Sunbird collects Personal Information, as listed in Section 2. Users may choose to discontinue the collection, use, and disclosure of their Personal Information by using Sunbird’s website without registering or by discontinuing their use of Sunbird’s website altogether.</p>
						<p>Please note that if Users provide any information directly to parties other than the Sunbird, including sites linked to by Sunbird’s Website, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the Personal Information Users disclose to them. Sunbird encourages Users to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 7. Correcting, updating, and deleting personal information</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird shall provide Users with the opportunity to opt in to receive communications from Sunbird. Once Users opt in, they can discontinue receiving updates about or other information from Sunbird by by sending a message to info@sunbird.org or directly unsubscribe through the link provided in the communication received from the Sunbird.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 8. Security procedures</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird has implemented security measures to protect Users’ information from loss, misuse, and alteration.Sunbird uses industry-standard practices, such as encrypted storage and password protection systems, to safeguard the confidentiality of Users’ Personal Information.</p>
						<p><strong>Section 9. Notification of changes</strong></p>
						<p>If Sunbird decides to use Users’ Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, Sunbird shall notify Users via email. Users may choose whether or not Sunbird may use such information in this manner. In addition, if Sunbird makes any material changes in its privacy practices that do not affect Users’ information already stored in its database, Sunbird shall post a prominent notice on the Sunbird’s website notifying Users of the change. In some cases where Sunbird posts such notice, Sunbird may also email Users who have opted to receive communications from Sunbird, notifying them of the changes in the Sunbird’s privacy practices.</p>
						<p>Sunbird believes strongly in respecting the privacy of its Users. Sunbird shall update and amend this statement if and when it is necessary. Please check back often to read the Sunbird’s most updated and amended statement. Upon posting the amended version, Sunbird shall take reasonable measures, either through email or other electronic medium, to obtain consent from Users to the amended terms.
